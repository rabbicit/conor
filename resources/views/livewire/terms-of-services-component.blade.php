(“Company”). Company reserves the sole right at any time to modify, discontinue or terminate the Site and Services, or modify the Terms of Service without notice. It is your responsibility to check these Terms of Service periodically for changes. By continuing to use or access the Site and/or Services after Company makes and posts any such modification, you agree to be legally bound by the revised Terms of Service. You may not alter the terms and conditions of the Terms of Service without Company’s express written consent.<br>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY USING THE SERVICES OFFERED BY COMPANY THROUGH THE SITE OR WITH RESPECT TO YOUR TopWave Music ACCOUNT, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF SERVICE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OFFERED BY COMPANY.</p><ol><li>GRANT OF RIGHTS.</li></ol><p>(a) The rights granted hereunder shall include the sale of Recordings (as defined in Section 2 below) by, without limitation, permanent digital downloads, temporary digital downloads, interactive streaming, non-interactive streaming, cloud services and so-called “disc-on-demand” services. You and Company agree that the Internet consumer stores (“Consumer Stores”) (e.g., Apple Music, Amazon, Spotify, Rhapsody) licensed to exploit your Recordings hereunder must be approved by you.<br>(b) By clicking the “I Agree” button, you irrevocably grant to Company, throughout the world (the “Territory”) and during the Term (as defined in Section 7 below), the non-exclusive right:<br>I. to sell, copy, reproduce, communicate to the public, distribute and otherwise exploit the Recordings by all means and media (whether now known or existing in the future) (“Sale”) through any and all Consumer Stores now operational or hereafter available;<br>II. to collect all income deriving therefrom; and<br>III. to use the name(s), photographs and likenesses, artwork images, biographical and other information provided by you or the artists whose performances are embodied on the Recordings in connection with the Recordings and Company’s general business.<br>(c) You agree that you will not use the Site or Services to transmit, route, provide connections to or store any material that infringes copyrighted works or otherwise violates or promotes the violation of the intellectual property rights of any third party. You acknowledge and agree that Company may disable access to and/or terminate your account and/or remove or disable access to any Recordings or any associated materials you provide to Company in the event that Company receives any claim that, if true, would constitute a violation of your representations and warranties hereunder. Please see the Copyright Policy for further information.<br>(d) You agree not to engage in (or to permit, encourage, enlist, retain, or employ third parties to engage in), activities that, in Company’s sole discretion, constitute Streaming Manipulation.</p><ol><li>“Streaming Manipulation” means any activity and/or method which involves the artificial creation, by human or non-human means, of online or offline plays on audio and/or audio-visual streaming services, where such plays do not represent bona fide end-user listening and/or views initiated by genuine consumers and taking place in the reporting country. Streaming Manipulation may involve or include, but is not limited to, increasing, generating or manipulating play counts, sales, follow counts, engagement activity, or other key metrics used by the Services and/or any Consumer Store, through the use of (A) bots, scripts, viruses, worms or any other computer codes, files, programs or automated processes; and/or (B) click-farms, troll-farms, inauthentic accounts, shared account information, or virtual private networks. Streaming Manipulation can be the result of activities undertaken with respect to either individual or groups of Recordings in order to artificially improve chart positioning, increase market share, increase royalty or other payments, or for any other fraudulent or dishonest purposes.<br>II. You should be aware that Streaming Manipulation may be the result of the actions of a third party, such as a promotion or marketing company, record label or music distributor, acting on behalf of an artist or on its own behalf. You are encouraged to investigate and vet any companies or individuals you may enlist, retain, or employ to promote or market your music, as you may be liable for Streaming Manipulation perpetrated by a third party on your behalf. For the avoidance of doubt, any Streaming Manipulation done by a third party on your behalf or that relates to your Recordings is a violation of these Terms of Service.<br>III. The factors used to determine whether any particular consumption or marketing activity is Streaming Manipulation will vary according to the specific circumstances of each case and the examples and descriptions of Streaming Manipulation set forth herein are not intended to be exhaustive.<br>IV. Certain Consumer Stores that use your Recordings may also have policies related to fraud and suspected fraudulent activities and you agree that it is your responsibility to become aware of and follow such policies, and such policies shall be binding upon you hereunder.<br>(e) In the event that Company has, in its good faith discretion, reason to suspect that your account or Recordings have been subjected to, involved in, or generated revenue from: violating the Terms of Service; fraud; infringement of copyright, trademark, right of publicity or any other intellectual property right; failure to comply with any third-party license requirement; or Streaming Manipulation (collectively, “Improper Conduct”), Company reserves the right to (i) discontinue the posting of income, including any Net Income or other payments to your account, (ii) block your ability to otherwise withdraw funds therefrom until resolution of the suspect activities to the satisfaction of Company is obtained, and (iii) remove any or all of your Recordings from any or all Consumer Stores. You further agree that such revenues will be forfeited by you if Company determines, in its good faith discretion, that your account or Recordings have been subjected to, involved in, or generated revenue from Improper Conduct.</li></ol><p>(f) You further agree to the following:<br>I. You agree to provide Company with any information reasonably requested by Company as part of its investigation into Improper Conduct.<br>II. You agree that if a Consumer Store notifies Company that any of your Recordings have generated revenue, plays, or streams as a result of Improper Conduct, such notice will serve as sufficient evidence for Company to determine, in its good faith discretion, that such revenues or plays are the result of Improper Conduct.<br>III. Upon Company’s determination that your account or Recordings have been subjected to, involved in, or generated revenue from Improper Conduct, you agree that all revenue in your account that has been frozen by Company is forfeited, regardless of whether it was generated from any specific Recording(s) or Consumer Store.<br>IV. You agree that Company’s good faith determination of Improper Conduct can be based on streaming or other activity that is the same or similar to cases that the Company has previously determined involved Improper Conduct.<br>V. The payment of revenues to you by Company does not constitute Company’s acknowledgement that such revenues were not the result of Improper Conduct.<br>VI. Company has no duty to investigate Improper Conduct unless and until it freezes revenues in your account.<br>VII. If Company determines that revenues generated to your account are the result of Improper Conduct, and such revenues have already been paid out to you, you agree to return such revenues to Company.<br>VIII. You agree that you will not be entitled to reimbursement for any fees paid by you to Company in the event Company disables access to your account, your Recordings and/or any other materials you provide to Company, or to any revenues forfeited by you as set forth in the preceding sentence.<br>IX. To the extent that Company, in its good faith discretion, determines that any Improper Conduct was caused by you or your affiliates’ actions or omissions or by any third party acting on your behalf or at your direction, any costs incurred by Company (including legal fees and expenses) in connection therewith may, in addition to its other remedies, be deducted by Company from any monies otherwise payable to you.<br>X. If in Company’s reasonable business judgment it elects to engage an attorney to review potential Improper Conduct or review and/or respond to any third-party allegation of Improper Conduct by you or associated with your account or Recordings, Company shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to deduct from your account or charge any alternate payment method you provide to Company (such as a PayPal account, credit card or debit card) (each a “Payment Method”) the cost of such engagement, but at a minimum Three Hundred Dollars ($300), to offset the costs of associated legal fees and expenses.<br>(g) Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to review and/or monitor any activity and content uploaded by you. Company may investigate any complaints or any reported violation of its policies and may take any action that it deems appropriate. Such action may include, but is not limited to, issuing warnings, suspension or termination of service, denying access and/or removal of any materials you may have uploaded. You agree that Company reserves the right and may terminate your account in its sole discretion for any reason and at any time, including if, in Company’s good faith discretion, you are believed to have engaged in Improper Conduct.<br>(h) The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tunecore.com/terms?section=social-platforms-updated">Social Platforms Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;shall apply to you in the event you opt to distribute your Recordings via “Social Platforms” (as such term is defined in the Social Platforms Terms of Service).</p><ol start="2"><li>RECORDINGS.</li></ol><p>The term “Recordings” shall be defined as the sound recordings and audiovisual recordings that you submit to Company at any time. Company, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to reject any materials (including, without limitation, Recordings, images and/or artwork) that you submit. You agree to submit all Recordings, images and artwork at your sole expense, in the format(s) required by Company or the Consumer Stores. Technical descriptions of such format(s) will be provided to you upon request, provided that Company reserves the right to convert audio files of the Recordings as necessary to meet the format and/or file size requirements of all Consumer Stores. In addition, Company will have the right to correct metadata errors to meet Consumer Store requirements. Company undertakes to provide your Recordings to Consumer Stores as quickly as possible, with timelines ranging from a few hours, to a few days to several weeks in order for the particular Consumer Stores to ingest and make your Recordings available to customers. In addition, you agree that Company and/or its suppliers will have the right to supplement existing artwork necessary to complete the packaging for discs-on-demand. Reasonable efforts will be made to provide you with approval rights over such artwork, but in the event that you object to any such artwork your only remedy shall be to (a) provide appropriate replacement artwork or (b) request prospective discontinuation of delivery of your materials in such manner. In no circumstances shall Company have any liability to you with respect to the quality, sufficiency or other aspect of the creation and delivery of such discs-on-demand.</p><ol start="3"><li>PAYMENTS.</li></ol><p>(a) Company will pay you one hundred percent (100%) of Net Income (as defined in Section 3(b) below). Net Income will be posted to your TopWave Music account in a timely fashion after Company’s receipt thereof. Once payment has been credited to your account, you will be able to withdraw all or any portion at your discretion. You will be responsible for any bank fees or other charges related to such withdrawals.<br>(b) “Net Income” shall be defined as Company’s actual receipts from Consumer Stores less any tax, fee or other charge related to the Sale of your Recordings. Any objection relating to any accounting statement or any lawsuit arising therefrom must be made (and any lawsuit commenced) no later than one (1) year after the date the statement is rendered, and you hereby waive any longer statute of limitations that may be permitted by law.<br>(c) To the extent that you owe any amounts to Company as a consequence of the Terms of Service or otherwise, Company shall have the right to deduct all or a portion of such amounts from any Net Income otherwise payable to you.<br>(d) The Net Income posted to your TopWave Music account will be pooled in an interest-bearing bank account with the Net Income of other TopWave Music customers until you withdraw such funds. You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the Net Income that Company handles as your agent and places in such pooled account. In consideration for your use of the Services, you irrevocably transfer and assign to Company any ownership right that you may have in any interest that may accrue on Net Income held in such pooled account. In addition to or instead of earning interest on such pooled account, Company may receive a reduction in fees or expenses charged for banking services by the banks that hold your Net Income.<br>(e) In connection with your decision to use the TopWave Music streaming media player, iPhone application or other so-called widgets or applications (the “Streaming Players”) as platforms for users to stream your Recordings, you hereby waive any right to digital artist royalties, performance royalties or any other fees or royalties, statutory or otherwise, that Company may be obligated to pay you or a third party in connection with the use of such Streaming Players. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that you utilize a Streaming Player on your own website or authorize its use on any other website on the Internet, you acknowledge and agree that Company is not responsible to make any third party payments in connection with the Recordings and underlying musical compositions which you own and/or control.<br>(f) To the extent that you elect to use certain Recordings from your TopWave Music catalog to distribute free to any parties (via a Streaming Player, directly through your own website or otherwise), you agree that you will be solely responsible for any of the above referenced third party payment obligations resulting from such deliveries. Without limiting any of the foregoing, you expressly agree to either waive music publishing royalties (if you own or control such rights) or pay any necessary royalties due to third party music publishers as a result of any such free distribution.</p><ol start="4"><li>THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS.</li></ol><p>(a) You shall be solely responsible for securing and paying for digital phonorecord delivery, mechanical, public performance and any other licenses (as applicable) required from musical composition copyright owners or their agents in connection with Company’s exploitation of rights hereunder, as well as royalties due to artists, producers and other persons who performed in the making of the Recordings and all payments that may be required under collective bargaining agreements or pursuant to any statutory schemes.<br>(b) For digital download sales in the United States, your payment typically includes the mechanical royalty on the underlying composition. In the case of the iTunes Match service, your payment includes a publishing portion that covers both the mechanical and public performance royalties. If you do not own or control the underlying composition(s) in your sound recording(s), it is your obligation to pay these publishing royalties to the person or entity that does. Outside of the United States, Company customarily requires Consumer Stores to secure and pay for music publishing licenses (and such license fees may or may not be deducted by the Consumer Store concerned from the proceeds payable to Company). If any Consumer Store outside of the United States does not agree to secure and pay for music publishing licenses, Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to either (i) decline to license such Consumer Store or (ii) assume the responsibility to clear and pay for the music publishing licenses required in connection with such Consumer Store’s Sales, which license fees Company shall have the right to deduct from amounts payable to you hereunder. To the extent that Company is required or elects, in its sole discretion, to pay any of the foregoing amounts, such payments will be deducted from any amounts otherwise payable to you hereunder.<br>(c) To the extent that Company permits you to select certain Recordings from your TopWave Music catalog to distribute free to fans or directly through your own website, you agree that you will be solely responsible for any of the above referenced third party payment obligations resulting from such deliveries.</p><ol start="5"><li>WARRANTIES; REPRESENTATIONS; INDEMNITIES.</li></ol><p>(a) You warrant and represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age, you have the full right, power and authority to enter into this agreement and to grant to Company all rights specified; all of the Recordings, including, without limitation, any sampled third party material embodied therein, artwork, metadata, audiovisuals, images and any other materials furnished by you to Company or relating to the Recordings are owned or controlled by you and the use thereof as described or contemplated herein and/or on the Site and/or Consumer Stores’ websites shall not infringe on the copyrights, trademark rights, publicity rights or other rights of any person or entity; and that Company shall have the right to exploit same in any manner hereunder free from adverse claim and without any obligation to make any payment of any nature to any person or entity other than the amounts payable to you hereunder.<br>(b) You shall defend and indemnify Company and any of its affiliates (including any directors, members, officers, employees and other representatives) and hold them harmless against any third party claims or expenses and losses resulting from breach or a claim which, if true, would constitute a breach of the foregoing representations and warranties or any of the agreements contained in these Terms of Service, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses.<br>(c) Company shall give you prompt notice of any claim that is subject to the foregoing indemnification obligation and you shall defend Company at your expense with counsel approved by Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event you fail to retain approved counsel, Company may, if it so elects, defend itself at your cost and expense and you agree that Company may require your participation in such defense as a third party or otherwise and you hereby waive any objection or claim to compensation in respect of same. If a claim is made Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to remove or disable access to the Recordings and/or any associated materials that are the subject of such claim, and/or to withhold payment of any monies due hereunder in an amount reasonably related to the claim and potential expenses. Any settlement of any claim shall be subject to Company’s prior written approval.<br>(d) THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES BY COMPANY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THE TERMS OF SERVICE.<br>6. SUBSCRIPTION FEES.<br>In consideration of the services rendered hereunder, all Recordings submitted by you and distributed by Company to the Consumer Stores require that you purchase a recurring fee-based subscription via a Payment Method. Such fees cover Company’s administrative expenses, distribution and artist support services, and on-going manual maintenance of your Recordings with Consumer Stores to meet their technical requirements and specifications and the performance of such work by Company represents a principal and indivisible part of the Services. These fees may be amended from time to time by Company without notice to you. You expressly agree that Company is authorized to deduct your recurring subscription fees, any applicable tax and other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Services directly from your TopWave Music account (i.e., your share of Net Income) or charge such fees to any Payment Method you provide to Company. You are solely responsible for all charges, fees, duties, taxes, and assessments arising out of any use of your TopWave Music account by you or anyone else using your account. If you notify Company in writing that you are terminating your subscription for one or more of your Recordings, no further subscription fees will be charged to your TopWave Music account or Payment Method for those Recordings and all terminated Recordings will be removed from their respective Consumer Stores. You will not be entitled to reimbursement of any pre-paid fees with respect to any terminated Recordings. If for any reason you fail to make a payment or a payment is reversed hereunder via the Payment Method or any other method after agreeing to these Terms of Service, Company will be entitled to recoup, at its sole discretion, the subscription fee, by any means necessary, including the right to keep your account active and collect any resulting royalties until the subscription fee is fully recouped.
